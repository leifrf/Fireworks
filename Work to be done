November 21.

Everything is working with basic settings. Time to make this program more robust and finish off the fine parts.

1) Add exceptions for:

LIMITS & LEGALITY:
sparkCount
angle
wind
mass
radius
lifeTime
renderSize
density
maxExitVelocity
lengthOfTube
numberOfStars

IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPTIONS:
negative burnRate
*negative positions
null particle


2) Coding

WRITING:
write explosionSpark & explosionSparkEmitter - will be very similar to Emitter
clean up LaunchTube - currently with defaults
clean up Star - currently with defaults

CONSIDER CHANGES:
currently designed to iterate based on the time interval,
perhaps set an interval for spark launching different from the time interval


3) JavaDoc & green comments
all methods
all classes
especially for constructors
descriptions of each firework's display


4) GUI construction
Once the above is completed, write the basic.
Once the basic GUI is completed & tweaked, write more Firework types.
Once more fireworks have been written, update GUI.
